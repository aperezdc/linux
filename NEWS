 * Changed the kernel preemption mode to "No Forced Preemption (Server)",
   which makes more sense for a headless device like the Dreamplug.

 * Kernel image is now compressed with XZ, to have a smaller uImage
   and shorter boot times.

 * Enabled the CPU idle support, which is now available for the Marvell
   Kirkwood architecture.

 * Enabled basic MTD device support and the m25p80 to access the U-Boot
   environment variables, which are stored in a SPI NOR flash memory
   using a M25P-compatible controller. Proper address, environment size
   and flash block size have to be determined, to be able to read/write
   the environment using fw_printenv/fw_setenv.

 * Enabled power saving by default for wireless devices using the cfg80211
   layer. This enables hostapd to let clients to do power-saving naps in
   between DTIM intervals and save battery (note: not useful with the
   built-in SD8688 chip in AP mode).

 * Disabled the FPU emulation code. The ARMv5TE included in the Dreamplug
   contains a hardware floating-point unit, so this is not needed.

 * Disabled drivers for Bluetooth controllers other than the integrated
   Marvell SDIO controller. It is very unlikely than a device other than
   the integrated in the Dreamplug would ever be plugged to it.

 * Disabled support for SCSI CDROM drives, which did not make much sense
   to keep around.

 * Disabled the software watchdog driver, in favour of the hardware
   watchdog present in the Dreamplug.


2013-05-13  3.10.0-rc1-00009-g18d84db

 * The "libertas_sdio" wifi driver will work fine. Tested in *client* mode.

 * A version of the "uap8xxx" wifi driver, forward-ported from the Marvell
   patch set available at several places, supporting AP mode is included,
   but the firmware and the "uaputl" tool are not included in the tarballs.
   You can use a copy of those from your current installation. Note that
   this is *untested* for the moment.

 * The "mwifiex" wifi driver needed for later revisions of the Dreamplug
   is included. Note that I do not own a plug with the new wireless chip,
   so this is *untested by me*.

 * Last, but not least, I have been able to adapt the "libertas_tf_sdio"
   wifi driver from the OLPC XO-1.5 kernel sources, which theoretically
   supports all of client, mesh and AP modes, but it was designed for the
   SD8686 chip. The Dreamplug has a SD8688, which is very similar, but I
   haven't been able of getting it to load the firmware. I don't have
   specific firmware for the SD8688 chip, so I tried with the SD8686 one,
   which makes the kernel panic when removing the driver. This could work
   if you are able to find a Dreamplug with a SD8686. Beware, YMMV.
